# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [02/12/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Newton-Raphson
* Decomposition and abstraction
* Functions and their arguments and return values

**Thoughts:**
I took some time to review slide 23 which I had reviewed previously. There's a line of code on the third function whose error I think I understand, but I'm not entirely sure. I may go back and review it again later. Either way, I grasp it a lot more than last time.

No commits today.



### Day 2: [02/13/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Recursion
* Inductive reasoning in programming

**Thoughts:**
I'm taking my time through recursion to make sure I understand everything well. I seem to have a very good grasp of it; now I just need to work on implementing it into my code elegantly. I had a solution for an exercise that I feel can be improved. I think it's well written but I want to be able to code elegant solutions, not just correct ones. I'll come back to look at exercise 'is in' at a later time. Maybe I could come up with a better solution later.

### Day 3: [02/14/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* PSet 2
* Peer review
* Tuples
* Lists

**Thoughts:**
I completed PSet 2 with relative ease. During the bisection exercise, I had to take a little more time to think about how my loop and the algorithm was going to work together to give me the result, but I managed. I also did the peer review exercise which gave me an opportunity to look at the code of some of my peers to then analyze my own and see what I could improve. I've liked the elegance of my code and my attempts to write good, clean code, but I need to write more comments. I also want to go back to the PSet and some of the exercises and write them recursively in addition to my iterative solutions. I finished half of lecture 5. I'll probably finish Lecture 5 by tomorrow and also get started on watching Lecture 3 of CS 50.

### Day 4: [02/15/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Aliasing
* Mutation
* Cloning

**Thoughts:**
I got some coding in before heading out today. I wanted to make sure I took a look at some stuff before my whole day got started. I'm glad I did as I wasn't able to do much beyond that. I took a look at cloning, aliasing, and mutation. I'm not sure how some of these concepts vary by language. I haven't looked at pointers yet technically in CS50, but I have heard and read about them a little. I think they're coming up in the next lecture so I could get a better scope conceptually. -fmc

### Day 5: [02/16/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Functions as objects
* map()
* New IDE (CS50)

**Thoughts:**
I got to code before I head out today (again). I got to look at functions as objects. Something that interests me is how map() works. It seems to return a 'list' type object. I'm saying 'list' type since it's not really a list, but acts like one. I think it works in the same way range() does. I'll try to finish that lecture by Monday, but I want to start taking a look at Lecture 3 for CS50. I've started looking at the notes and will watch the video lectures tomorrow through Monday.

### Day 6: [02/17/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Structures review
* Dictionaries

**Thoughts:**
I just reviewed structures. I started learning a little bit about dictionaries as well.

### Day 7: [02/18/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Dictionaries
* Global variables
* Memoization

**Thoughts:**
Went deepers into dictionaries. Used a dictionary to count the frequency of a each word appearing in a song's lyrics. I made my own function that cleaned up the song lyrics as well to supplement the lesson. This would remove capitalization and any punctuation (besides apostrophes) so that each word would be counted accurately regardless of its formatting. I then reviewed using dictionaries to determine Fibonacci numbers more efficiently using much less computations in a method called memoization. We finished off by using global variables to compare the number of computations in the old and new way of doing the Fibonacci sequence. I find it interesting that what max() returns depends on the type of its argument. In an exercise, I was able to use it to return me a list with the most items. Building a Hangman game for this next PSet will be challenging but fun.

### Day 8: [02/19/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* PSet 3 MIT Python - Hangman
* Pointers
* structs
* char *
* malloc
* free

**Thoughts:**
CS50 and C shows me how much is abstracted in Python. It's incredible to know how much we don't have to think about while programming in Python. We did get a little bit of a teaser for pointers from MIT Python. The is keyword determinds whether two variables are pointing to the same object. But it wasn't explicitly expressed like in this course. I'm glad that I'm taking both courses concurrently so that I could see the differences between the two languages and appreciate how much Python abstracts for us.
