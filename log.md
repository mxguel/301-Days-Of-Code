# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [02/12/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Newton-Raphson
* Decomposition and abstraction
* Functions and their arguments and return values

**Thoughts:**
I took some time to review slide 23 which I had reviewed previously. There's a line of code on the third function whose error I think I understand, but I'm not entirely sure. I may go back and review it again later. Either way, I grasp it a lot more than last time.

### Day 2: [02/13/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Recursion
* Inductive reasoning in programming

**Thoughts:**
I'm taking my time through recursion to make sure I understand everything well. I seem to have a very good grasp of it; now I just need to work on implementing it into my code elegantly. I had a solution for an exercise that I feel can be improved. I think it's well written but I want to be able to code elegant solutions, not just correct ones. I'll come back to look at exercise 'is in' at a later time. Maybe I could come up with a better solution later.

### Day 3: [02/14/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* PSet 2
* Peer review
* Tuples
* Lists

**Thoughts:**
I completed PSet 2 with relative ease. During the bisection exercise, I had to take a little more time to think about how my loop and the algorithm was going to work together to give me the result, but I managed. I also did the peer review exercise which gave me an opportunity to look at the code of some of my peers to then analyze my own and see what I could improve. I've liked the elegance of my code and my attempts to write good, clean code, but I need to write more comments. I also want to go back to the PSet and some of the exercises and write them recursively in addition to my iterative solutions. I finished half of lecture 5. I'll probably finish Lecture 5 by tomorrow and also get started on watching Lecture 3 of CS 50.

### Day 4: [02/15/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Aliasing
* Mutation
* Cloning

**Thoughts:**
I got some coding in before heading out today. I wanted to make sure I took a look at some stuff before my whole day got started. I'm glad I did as I wasn't able to do much beyond that. I took a look at cloning, aliasing, and mutation. I'm not sure how some of these concepts vary by language. I haven't looked at pointers yet technically in CS50, but I have heard and read about them a little. I think they're coming up in the next lecture so I could get a better scope conceptually. -fmc

### Day 5: [02/16/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Functions as objects
* map()
* New IDE (CS50)

**Thoughts:**
I got to code before I head out today (again). I got to look at functions as objects. Something that interests me is how map() works. It seems to return a 'list' type object. I'm saying 'list' type since it's not really a list, but acts like one. I think it works in the same way range() does. I'll try to finish that lecture by Monday, but I want to start taking a look at Lecture 3 for CS50. I've started looking at the notes and will watch the video lectures tomorrow through Monday.

### Day 6: [02/17/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Structures review
* Dictionaries

**Thoughts:**
I just reviewed structures. I started learning a little bit about dictionaries as well.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 7: [02/18/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Dictionaries
* Global variables
* Memoization

**Thoughts:**
Went deepers into dictionaries. Used a dictionary to count the frequency of a each word appearing in a song's lyrics. I made my own function that cleaned up the song lyrics as well to supplement the lesson. This would remove capitalization and any punctuation (besides apostrophes) so that each word would be counted accurately regardless of its formatting. I then reviewed using dictionaries to determine Fibonacci numbers more efficiently using much less computations in a method called memoization. We finished off by using global variables to compare the number of computations in the old and new way of doing the Fibonacci sequence. I find it interesting that what max() returns depends on the type of its argument. In an exercise, I was able to use it to return me a list with the most items. Building a Hangman game for this next PSet will be challenging but fun.

### Day 8: [02/19/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* PSet 3 MIT Python - Hangman
* Pointers
* structs
* char *
* malloc
* free

**Thoughts:**
CS50 and C shows me how much is abstracted in Python. It's incredible to know how much we don't have to think about while programming in Python. We did get a little bit of a teaser for pointers from MIT Python. The is keyword determinds whether two variables are pointing to the same object. But it wasn't explicitly expressed like in this course. I'm glad that I'm taking both courses concurrently so that I could see the differences between the two languages and appreciate how much Python abstracts for us.

### Day 9: [02/20/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Watched CS50 - Lecture 3
* Pointers
* Memory allocation
* Dereferencing
* Hexadecimal

**Thoughts:**
I'm beginning to understand referencing and dereferencing more as I rewatch and work alongside the lecture. Memory allocation is a very interesting concept and one that makes me glad that I am taking CS50. Receiving input from a user seems to be a very complex process that luckily has been abstracted in the course with a function, but I'm wondering if this is going to be something that I will have to deal with in the future when I move on beyond this course.

### Day 10: [02/21/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Pointers
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Call stacks

**Thoughts:**
I took my time with pointers and dynamic memory allocation. There are still bits of the latter that I need to go back to fully understand, but pointers were the biggest hurdle for me today (aside from feeling ill). It feels weird that I feel that I understand pointers where at the beginning of the day, I felt like I wasn't even close. I think that once I wake up and review these concepts again tomorrow, I will feel even better about them (especially about malloc()). What made pointers the hardest to understand was the syntax. Syntaxially they could be written better, but I'm glad I took the time to understand. I look forward to working on the PSet.

### Day 11: [02/22/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Pointers
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Recursion in C
* Built a web scraper using Beautiful Soup and Python

**Thoughts:**
WOW! I got good distracted today. I saw that CS50 on Twitch was having a stream on webscraping so I decided to focus my morning and early afternoon on working along with the stream and I'm glad I did. I got some exposure to a couple of tools that I could use for webscraping later and got a little practice with it. I finished watching the shorts for CS50 and cemented the concepts of pointers and memory allocation. I also took a look at recursion in C which was much easier after having seen it in Python. Onto the PSet and then back to some Python.

### Day 12: [02/23/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* structs
* calling lists by reference in Python
* recursion

**Thoughts:**
The PSet for CS50 broke so I wasn't able to really work on it. As a result, I decided to take the midterm for MIT Python. Recusion and lists were heavily emphasized. I barely finished in time. I struggled a lot with the last two questions (especially the second to last one with recusion) but I managed to pull through. Apparently, I could call a list by reference in Python to mutate the list without returning the list. I could return a different value which was a very interesting discovery. The PSet 3 looks very tough, but I'm sure that once I take some time to work on it, I'll pull through.

### Day 13: [02/24/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* structs
* bmp files
* typedef

**Thoughts:**
As I look through these problems in this PSet, the problem starts getting less and less intimidating. I start realizing how much I understand and how much and how quickly I could learn concepts that are simply extensions of my current knowledge. I still have more reading and exploring to do to finish up this PSet, but my confidence in my ability to keep this journey going keeps rising. Among the catalysts are the people that support me and doubt me. Let's keep going.

### Day 14: [02/25/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* structs

**Thoughts:**
I'm working through this PSet trying to figure out structs. I had misunderstood them when I was originally working with them thinking that there were variables in them that are now defined, but in actuality, the struct actually creates a type of variable such as making a new type like an int. This misunderstanding delayed my progress but now that I'm clear on what I have to work with, I can now move forward with the PSet.

No commits today.




### Day 15: [02/26/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* bitmaps
* manipulating while replicating files

**Thoughts:**
I finished the first part of the PSet. I think that the rest of this PSet will be much faster since I mostly understand the structs created and the file that copies files and enables us to manipulate the copy of the file. I was simply playing around with the file to solve the solution and I managed to figure out the solution. Looking forward to finishing the PSet.

No commits today.



### Day 16: [02/27/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Understanding bmp manipulation
* Understanding the padding on bmp files

**Thoughts:**
I'm misunderstanding something. I don't understand why these bmp files require padding. I need to take a look at the headers and the rest of the files first before I move on. And if I understand why there's horizontal padding, I need to understand why there is no vertical padding. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have a breakthrough and move forward.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 17: [02/28/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* More understanding bmp manipulation (resize)
* Understanding padding
* Error checking in resize
* Drew out plan to finish resize

**Thoughts:**
I made significant progress in understand resize and formulating a plan. I might run into a few issues as I move along through the code, but I feel fairly confident that I'll be able to finish up this problem by the end of the weekend. I've identified each struct variable that I'll have to change for the newer one.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 18: [03/01/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Determining manipulating constants
* Finding out where each needs to be manipulated

**Thoughts:**
I'm starting to wonder how much debugging is going to need to be done. I'm looking at some of my code, and it looks great. But I think there might be some issues with the tranformation variable. I'm not sure if I could assign a variable the value (changed) from another struct. Regardless I think that our first prototype of this will be the separated cube. We'll see the rest of my progress over the weekend.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.


### Day 19: [03/02/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Testing/Debugging
* Black box vs glass box testing

**Thoughts:**
As my resources were limited today, I decided to go back to Python as I worked though some of the lecture for the next PSet. I figured I could go back and do this until I have more time to sit down and actually work through the problem of transforming that image. I still have work to do in both regards, but I think I should start developing good programming habits including writing docstrings for my functions and modularizing my programs. In the long run, this will help me become a better programmer.

No commits today.



### Day 20: [03/03/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* More Testing/Debugging

**Thoughts:**
As my weekends are extremely limited and I am not able to work too much during them, I was able to finish up half of the lecture by today on testing and debugging but nothing more. I still think it's more important to be able to continue working daily rather than focusing on other negatives. Tomorrow the new week starts so I expect to have the rest of the lecture done.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 21: [03/04/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Even more Testing/Debugging
* Overt v Covert bugs
* Error messages

**Thoughts:**
I finished up the rest of the testing and debugging lecture. While a lot of this is mostly theoretical and abstract, it's important to keep a lot of these concepts in mind while approaching more and more of my courses. I think this is what I needed to be able to approach the problem in C with a fresh set of eyes and with the right mindset. I hope to be able to tackle the rest of that tomorrow as well as finish up this week's Python lectures.

No commits today.



### Day 22: [03/05/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* exceptions
* assertions
* try...else
* raise
* finally

**Thoughts:**
Exceptions in Python. It's interesting how they're executed in this language. In C you have a main function so you try to catch all errors that way, but not here. There seems to be more flexibility with how you catch or deal with these error messages. I think it's a little odd, but I'm starting to remember some keywords in JavaScript similar to these (or maybe identical) where other people used some of these keywords to catch error messages. I'm happy that I got to see how this is implemented in Python. It's time to move onto more PSets.

### Day 23: [03/06/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* making copies for dictionaries
* created functions for Scrabble type game to score a word and update a hand

**Thoughts:**
I used assert here to contain some of the potential return errors of a function although I don't think that we'll get an error at all in its current state. I think it's best to leave it there for any future modifications. This is another PSet where we're breaking down a bigger problem into modular functions. It's great how we get to develop these into a bigger program, and I hope to be able to do this on my own soon enough without the additional guidance.

No commits today.



### Day 24: [03/07/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* finished Scrabble simple text game
* greedy algorithms

**Thoughts:**
I finished up building the text Scrabble game. I developed 2 main functions: one that enables the user to play (player's code) and one that enables the computer to play (computer's code). I was moving along swiftly until I ran into a bug in the player's code. Apparently I wasn't manipulating the dictionary that I needed to manipulate. Afterwards, I was able to work on the computer's code which gave me more trouble. I had to edit the code a few times to iron out the bugs, but I managed to do it. I also briefly misunderstood the instructions. I believe the prompt was a little misleading so my code isn't entirely clean even though it works properly. Maybe I'll clean it up over the weeked and commit it to a new repo on here for my first project based commit.

No commits today.



### Day 25: [03/08/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Object oriented programming
* Classes

**Thoughts:**
We're starting classes and objects. My friend had described objects as being what allows us to model the world as we understand it in a way that the computer can process it. I'm excited to get going on this. They remind me of structs in C, but conceptually they seem a bit tougher. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mind set to approach this. I think what I need is a fresh pair of eyes on it tomorrow. The syntax is also something I need to take a look at to understand more about how these work.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 26: [03/09/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Syntax of classes

**Thoughts:**
I still have yet to wrap my head around how the syntax for this works so I took time today to go through my notes and refresh my memory while also trying to understand every concept presented in the notes. It might take me a couple of days to truly understand classes, but that's how I felt about structs. I should be fine; I just need more time with them.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 27: [03/10/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Continuation of classes syntax
* Beginning of methods

**Thoughts:**
I'm reviewing these notes to make sure that when I go through the video lectures again, I will understand everything. When I first watched a few of them, everything felt like it was going over my head so I'd rather employ the strategy I was using for CS50 to continue working on this. I'll be able to run through the entire lecture tomorrow.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 28: [03/11/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Continued syntax of classes
* Continue learning about methods

**Thoughts:**
I'm finally bringing together methods and the syntax of classes and their attributes. Instances of classes can be referred to by different variables via '=' so I have to look at that example again tomorrow. It reminds me of what was happening with lists earlier in the course. I have to make sure I understand how this happens so I don't end up making bigger mistakes in my code later when working on my own stuff. Looking forward to a full day of code tomorrow.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 29: [03/12/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Classes
* Defining attributes and methods in classes

**Thoughts:**
As I'm finally getting the opportunity to work with classes, I'm catching on, but it's taking me a little more time than it usually does. I think that since I haven't been exposed to these before too much, it's taking more time for it to sink in. Tomorrow I'll get a chance to work with extended examples. We'll see how that goes.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 30: [03/13/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Classes
* Examples of hierarchies

**Thoughts:**
Finished up my work with classes as I looked at different hierarchies and a complex example. The example emphasized superclasses and subclasses and we got to look at different ways of initializing subclasses by using the superclass's initialization method and building on it within the class's initialization method. I feel that this will be important in the PSet as we keep working with classes and look at other examples.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 31: [03/14/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Examples of classes
* Learning through Python Tutor and exercises

**Thoughts:**
The hierarchy portion of the classes, while intuitive, was confusing. I took some time today to review and try to understand what was happening when. Initiatlizing an instance can provide more information than initially useful which threw me off. You can set a variable to None and change the default later with a setter. I'm working through an example that I started after working through those mind-boggling examples. We'll get to work through more hierarchy examples next.

**Link to work:**
No commits today.



### Day 32: [03/15/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* More examples
* Building classes
* Hierarchies
* pass statement

**Thoughts:**
I'm a little stuck on an example I'm working on. There's a speak method that we're assigning to two different classes; one is a subclass of another class. For some reason, the subclass uses its superclass's function and adds more to it to modify the function. I'm unsure why or how this is happening, but I'm sure that once I look at it with a fresh mind tomorrow, I'll be able to understand more of what is going on. Its very helpful to work through another example since this topic seems to be so much more complex than some of the previous ones. I'm going to take my time but work efficiently to keep on leaning this.

No commits today.



### Day 33: [03/16/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Scrabble with classes

**Thoughts:**
We're doing something interesting now as a way to practice more with classes. We're working on the Scrabble problem but with classes now. It'll be interesting how I can use classes to essentially implement the same problem I worked on previously. Other than that, I reviewed more examples with classes and hierarchies.
