# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [02/12/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Newton-Raphson
* Decomposition and abstraction
* Functions and their arguments and return values

**Thoughts:**
I took some time to review slide 23 which I had reviewed previously. There's a line of code on the third function whose error I think I understand, but I'm not entirely sure. I may go back and review it again later. Either way, I grasp it a lot more than last time.

No commits today.



### Day 2: [02/13/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Recursion
* Inductive reasoning in programming

**Thoughts:**
I'm taking my time through recursion to make sure I understand everything well. I seem to have a very good grasp of it; now I just need to work on implementing it into my code elegantly. I had a solution for an exercise that I feel can be improved. I think it's well written but I want to be able to code elegant solutions, not just correct ones. I'll come back to look at exercise 'is in' at a later time. Maybe I could come up with a better solution later.

### Day 3: [02/14/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* PSet 2
* Peer review
* Tuples
* Lists

**Thoughts:**
I completed PSet 2 with relative ease. During the bisection exercise, I had to take a little more time to think about how my loop and the algorithm was going to work together to give me the result, but I managed. I also did the peer review exercise which gave me an opportunity to look at the code of some of my peers to then analyze my own and see what I could improve. I've liked the elegance of my code and my attempts to write good, clean code, but I need to write more comments. I also want to go back to the PSet and some of the exercises and write them recursively in addition to my iterative solutions. I finished half of lecture 5. I'll probably finish Lecture 5 by tomorrow and also get started on watching Lecture 3 of CS 50.
