# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [02/12/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
* Newton-Raphson
* Decomposition and abstraction
* Functions and their arguments and return values

**Thoughts:**
I took some time to review slide 23 which I had reviewed previously. There's a line of code on the third function whose error I think I understand, but I'm not entirely sure. I may go back and review it again later. Either way, I grasp it a lot more than last time.
